Welcome to An' Khalmar, a fractured world where your choices shape your very essence. This is a text-based adventure RPG written in Python, designed to explore narrative-driven decision-making, hidden paths, and stat-based endings.

This is my first game project, created with a focus on storytelling, player choice, and replayability.

 Game Overview

In An' Khalmar, players journey through various biomes, each with unique challenges and choices:

Forest – Ancient woods that whisper secrets.

Marsh/Bog – Misty, dangerous wetlands that test your patience.

Desert – Harsh sands that challenge clarity and will.

Ocean – Deep waters filled with wonder and peril.

Volcano – A land of creation and destruction.

Tundra – Unforgiving ice and ancient watchers.

Mountains – Jagged peaks that reward perseverance.

Welkin – A final realm between sky and thought, revealing the truth of your journey.

Players make choices in each biome, gaining or sacrificing stats:

Wisdom – Knowledge and insight.

Will – Strength of action and courage.

Patience – Calm and perseverance.

Detachment – How often you leave or avoid challenges.

Some paths and endings are hidden, only unlocked by maintaining balance among your stats.

Features

Stat-driven gameplay – Every choice affects your journey and your final title.

Hidden paths – Achieve the “Scales of Sands” only if you maintain balanced stats.

Multiple endings – Titles are awarded based on your choices, including:

The Bearer of Scales – Balance and mastery

The Defiant Ascendant – Will-focused

The Keeper Who Remains – Patience-focused
